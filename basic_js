//18. Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
//In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the ///equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say

var myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a = a + 12;
b = 9 + b;
c = c + 7;

//to
a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;

//17. Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)

var remainder;
remainder = 11 % 3;

//Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.


//16. Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript

var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; 
//15.Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
 var product = 2.0 * 2.5;

//14.Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
//Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line


//13.Decrement a Number with JavaScript
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar - 1;
myVar --;

//12.Increment a Number with JavaScript
i++;
i = i + 1;

var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
//myVar = myVar + 1;
myVar ++;

//11.Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
var quotient = 66 / 33;

//10.Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
var product = 8 * 10;

//9.Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
var difference = 45 - 33;

//8.Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
var sum = 10 + 10;

//7. Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

//6. Understanding Uninitialized Variables
// Only change code below this line
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
// Only change code above this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

//5.Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
var a =9;

// Setup
var a;
a = 7;
var b;

// Only change code below this line

 b = a
